    "At this stage in the project you have built a model (or models) that appears to have high quality from a data analysis perspective. Before proceeding to final deployment of the model, it is important to more thoroughly evaluate the model and review the steps executed to construct the model to be certain it properly achieves the business objectives. A key objective is to determine if there is some important business issue that has not been sufficiently considered. At the end of this phase, a decision on the use of the data mining results should be reached."

Another option of evaluation is to test the model(s) on test applications in the real application if time and budget constraints permit.\n",
