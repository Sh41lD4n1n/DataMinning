Typically, there are several techniques for the same data mining problem type. Some techniques have specific requirements on the form of data.

This task interferes with the subsequent evaluation phase.

Moreover, this task only considers models whereas the evaluation phase also takes into account all other results that were produced in the course of the project. The data mining engineer tries to rank the models. He assesses the models according to the evaluation criteria. As far as possible he also takes into account business objectives and business success criteria. In most data mining projects, the data mining engineer applies a single technique more than once or generates data mining results with different alternative techniques. In this task, he also compares all results according to the evaluation criteria.\n",
