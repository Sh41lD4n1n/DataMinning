    "The first objective of the data analyst is to thoroughly understand, from a business perspective, what the client really wants to accomplish. Often the client has many competing objectives and constraints that must be properly balanced. The analyst's goal is to uncover important factors, at the beginning, that can influence the outcome of the project. A possible consequence of neglecting this step is to expend a great deal of effort producing the right answers to the wrong questions.\n",

In addition to the primary business objective, there are typically other related business questions that the customer would like to address. For example, the primary business goal might be to keep current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to a competitor. Examples of related business questions are \"How does the primary channel (e.g., ATM, visit branch, internet) a bank customer uses affect whether they stay or go?\" or \"Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce the number of high-value customers who leave?\"\n",

    "  Currently retail is the most popular way to sale goods and services to end-user. Retail need follow users' trends and provide relevant goods. Consider facts about retail.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  Retailers can be divided into **online and ofline**. The online shops brings to industry higher competition and requier retailer accurately select products for sale. Futhermore, online retailers make shops focuse on narrow spreads of items, as online retailer may suggest products with more quality to any user. It means retailer should know customers' interests to earn incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Consumers has dozens options when looking to purchase good. It means that retailer have high **competition** and need to analays castomer preferences to earn income.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The **income of retailer** is consist of sold amoung of products. It means retailer should controle prices to earn profit. Price can be one of two types: \"Cost-plus\" and \"Sugested retails\". In first case salesman can manipulate price (for example make it higher). But demand and competition doesn't allow saller infinitly increase price. Thus retailer should find optimal price. On second cost of product is determined by manufacturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### business objectives\n",
    "  From background we may conclude that, the main objective of retail business is earn maximum profit by saling goods from Store and faster react on clients requests to deal with competitors. It means retailer is intrestied in selecting goods that satisfy retailer's customer. Futhermore, retailer should deliver products to the closest to client warehouse. Thus, main business questions are:\n",

    "- Which products should retailer deliver to stores in some country?\n",
    "\n",

    "#### business success criteria\n",
    "Success criteria for retailer is satisfaction of majority of clients, efective use of warehouses (high quantity of sold product). This will bring benefits to retailer as he will be able to predicts products to collect, suggest better prices to customers and even earn higgher income.\n"

    "<b> Retail </b> is the sale of goods or service from a business to a consumer for their own use\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Demand</b> is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services depending on price.\n",
    "<b>Income</b> is money that a person or a business receives in return for working, providing a products.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Competition</b> is a scenario where many different retailers may suggest same goods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Costs and benefits\n",
    "Assume that there are exist software to collect purchases. Consider cost of using data analysis tool  and evaluating customers' needs with analysts team.\n",
    "First of all, evaluate cost of using software to analyze clients' demand. Cost of <b>development</b> of this application is 550\\\\$ per month (app will be ready during 3 month). When, project will be ready to use, retailer will spend 820\\\\$ per month (500\\\\$ is salary of <b>one analyst</b>, 250 \\\\$ per month is salary of <b>programer who will maintain application</b>, 70$ per month is cost of <b>server</b>). \n",
    "Finally software requier 1650\\\\$ for creation and 820\\\\$\\month for maintaining. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, calculate cost of predicting clients' requests by hand. In this case retailer will need <b>analyst team</b> of 3-4 person (as list of purchases is large). Thus sallary of **analyst** is 500\\\\$ per month. Finally retailer will spend 1500\\\\$ per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can conclude that, on long-term it is cheaper to pay for this project.\n",

    "- It requier less human sources\n",
    "    \n",
    "- It perform evaluation faster and can evaluate clients' needs frequently\n",

    "Finaly, consider benefits of retailer who don't have software to satisfy clients' needs:\n",
    "- Don't need to speend money for development\n",
